# Chained Viper
A ridiculous name for a needless module, but it's a functional-ish library for python. Want functional iterators? Options? Results? Monad-ish things? Here you go, with no guarantees or expectations of quality. It's more of an exercise, but if someone uses it, feel free to send bugs my way.


## Requirements
It has no external dependencies except for python3.6+. To install it:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

Since this isn't exactly a PyPI module.


## Tests
To run tests, you will need `pytest`:
```bash
python -m pip install pytest
python -m pytest
```
